FRAUD DETECTION

Introduction:

Fraud detection is a critical process in safeguarding financial systems against deceptive activities. With the increasing volume of online transactions, the risk of fraud has grown significantly, making it essential to develop advanced methods for identifying and preventing fraudulent behavior. By leveraging techniques such as anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and machine learning, fraud detection systems aim to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to design and implement a fraud detection system that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. By utilizing machine learning models and advanced analytics, the system will aim to enhance the detection accuracy, minimize false positives, and ensure scalability to handle large volumes of financial data.
